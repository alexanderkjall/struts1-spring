# Integration library between Struts 1.3 and Spring 5.0

Resurrected from the spring 3 code base and ported forward to spring 5.

Add dependency

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>no.hackeriet</groupId>
        <artifactId>struts1-spring5</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

and just replace `org.springframework.web.struts` with `no.hackeriet.struts1Spring.struts`.

Written because sometimes it's easier to write code than navigate politics.
